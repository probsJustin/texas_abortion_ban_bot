# Texas Abortion Ban Bot 
### About: 
Abortion ban self reporting bot based on selenium. I think it will send the 'rats fu**ing' pictures from last week tonight.  

### Current status: 
Thread executor/selenium script runner is working as intended, included in this repo is a selenium script for getting around recaptcha but it has not been implemented yet. Just ensure that youre selenium script is in a function called run and you can pass it to the executor. 

### Instructions: 
yeah probably not - probably not yet.... but it is going to be easy to use..... maybe?

### Ideas? (maybe?):
